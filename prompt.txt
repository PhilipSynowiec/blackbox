Here some entries could be None. There are the following possibilities for the grammatical type: v, n, prep, adv, adj, conj, phrase.
For the sentence with clozes, make sure that it is really suitable for the purpose of studying vocabulary with the cloze deletion method.
When creating flashcards for phrases that aren't necessarily grouped in the sentence, just enclose every part (group of consequent words) in {}.
Make sure that the example sentence really matches this word really well and better than other synonyms of that word.
Double check if the word is really a unique solution to the cloze sentence, i.e. if the sentence is specific enough.
Try to make each sentence very memorable and not  that politically correct and boring like in school books. We don't want boring vocab learning.
